pages-for-appchallenge
======================

Pages containing the building blocks for NSW App Challenge.

Use the lists of sites  in - (lists-variable-site.doc) to find intelligent groups of related sites.

Use the code in the html to see how to access the web services.

NB. For some reasons the html files don't work in 'internet explorer' (I'm using Ver 9). A team at 'Apps4NSW workshop' demo'ed in in V10 on Win 8. (good).
So to be sure to be sure try firefox/chrome/others.

GOOD LUCK.
SEE YOU AT UTS or somewhere else.
